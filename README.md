## Introduction
### About the Codebase
This is the codebase for TypeScript, a programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding natural syntax for type specifications to data and adding compiler functionality. Developers can use TypeScript to create their own applications, either client- or server-side.
### Authors/Maintainers
This software was developed by Microsoft (a large company) and is currently maintained by the company's employees (628 contributors). Additionally, contributions are accepted when following Microsoft's Code of Conduct, and a number of people appear to be in charge of approving these commits.
